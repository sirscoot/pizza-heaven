If the selected pizza has more up votes, it will be declared the saviour. Low votes change it to heretic, and if the votes are split it will remain in purgatory until more votes are cast upon it.

Users can look at the profile of each user and the pizzas they made only. But all votes must be done at the dashboard.


If there are more negative votes than positive votes, the user who made that pizza has the option to delete it. they can always edit it. But if they feel even slightly embarassed about their awful choice of what goes on a pizza, then the option will show itself.



All fun aside, most of what I learned went into this and it seemed to go over well. The only real issue I am still having is how long it now takes for the page to load. This happened after I added the pizza background. I'm going to assume it is because of the size and overall quality of the image that is causing it. I maybe should have scaled it down. It's a large stock photo. 7474 x 3760 lol...

Another issue i did have was vote counter. I spent maybe a day trying to get my dumb brain to make the update function for the vote counters.

One problem im still having is trying to make it so the user can only vote once per pizza. I probably have to do a check as boolean to confirm the users vote but was unsure about how to implement it in.

its simple. its there's nothing special about it, but i enjoyed making it.
